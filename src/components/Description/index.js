                            <p>It was about February, it was cold, and I felt completely and utterly creatively empty. I felt like I was stuck, stuck in a whole that I dug myself. I had done all I could do with Squarespace. That couldn't be true could it? I realized I hadn't tried to just work on NON-CLIENT projects, make the sites I always wanted to, the sites that showcase the brand the work and help clients see what is possible, not just the little things that they want.</p>
